spread spectrum

channel capacity theoram rate at which the signal is transmitted with low error
base2
C= Blog2(1+S/N) b=signal BW
S/N - Signal to noise ratio

Dependence of channel capacity(bps)
1. Bandwidth
2. Signal to noise ratio
 
*noisy case where S/N -> poor
*To transmit the signal over channel the bw of signal is increased

Spread spectrum quantification

1. Process gain(G): difference of the SNR(signal to noise ration)
with the SNR at the input G=BW(ss)/BW(us)
BW(US) actual information signal

2. Jamming Margin: to know the impact of interfernce and its tell  us about hr max level of interefernce that SS system can handle 

J(m) = G-(Lsys + (S/N)out) in db


Types of spread spectrum systems
1. Direct sequence : the modulated signal is  generated by a digital code sequence whose rate is muhc higher 
than that of the ionterfernce signal.

Frequency Hopped : the modulation is carried out using set of  carrier frequences and whose pattern is descirbed by the digital ciode

code sequence: pseudo noise/ pesudo 



DSSSS

Generation of spread spectrum equation

 d(t) - data signal to the psedu random signal(p(t))

then the signal will be 
s(t) = d(t)p(t)
 for frequency spectrum we have to look the for the modulated signal
s(f)(wide band) = d(f)(narrow band)*p(f)(wide band signal)
multiplication in one domain and convolution in other domain

s(t)->spread signal
y(t)(received signal)=s(t)+i(t) 

at receiver end

y(t)(depsread) -> *(p(t) is also fed) -> s'(t) 

s'(t) = p(t)y(t)
=p(t)(s(t)+i(t))
p(t)s(t) + p(t)i(t)

s'(t)=p(t)p(t)d(t)+p(t)i(t)
p^2(t)d(t)+p(t)i(t)


p(t) is a sequence of 1 & -1
p^2(t) = 1
s'(t) = d(t)+p(t)i(t)
